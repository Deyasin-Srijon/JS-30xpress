# 🧩 JS30xpress — 30 Mini JavaScript Projects

Welcome to **JS30xpress**, a collection of 30 mini JavaScript projects built to sharpen my skills, boost creativity, and have some fun while coding! ⚡

Each project is small in scope but focused on solving one concept or UI interaction using **Vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, no libraries, just pure JS magic ✨


## 🚀 Why This Repo?

As part of my learning journey, I’ve committed to building:
- 30 **bite-sized projects**
- using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- to explore core concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, APIs, animation, and more.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- No external libraries used (unless needed for API demos)


## 🧠 What I’m Practicing

- DOM Manipulation
- Event Listeners
- setInterval, setTimeout
- API fetching
- Local Storage
- UI Interactions
- Responsive design basics


## 🌟 Goals

- Keep it simple & functional
- Practice regularly
- Build a strong JS foundation
- Learn by building — not just watching
